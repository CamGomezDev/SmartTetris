# TetrisGodot

Artificial Intelligence that plays Tetris, coded from scratch in Godot. I made this for this YouTube video: https://youtu.be/9GrLQi0PvyY

It's based in this article: https://codemyroad.wordpress.com/2013/04/14/tetris-ai-the-near-perfect-player/

The AI works with a genetic algorithm that moves the pieces.

To run it just clone the repo and open it from Godot. It should work without a problem. It's all commented so you can check how it works for yourself.
